        <p>I am a JavaScript Full Stack (MEAN) developer based in Denver, CO. I graduated from Denison University with a B.A. in History. While in college, I played on the Varsity Basketball team and was an active member of many campus organizations. Prior to becoming a web developer, I worked in marketing and sales development. I also have experience in customer service, ski instruction, and the hospitality industry. I made the decision to move into software development after recognizing my interest in and aptitude for problem solving.</p>
        <p>Through the Galvanize Full Stack Immersive program I've gained core competencies in JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, AngularJS 1.x, Knex.js, jQuery, and Mocha/Chai testing.</p>
        <p>Outside of software development, Iâ€™m passionate about travel, family, history, and outdoor activities such as skiing, hiking, and backpacking.</p>
